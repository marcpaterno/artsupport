# artsupport
R package for analysis of _art_ framework performance data

The _art_ framework's _TimeTracker_ service can write an SQLite database containing event-by-event and module-by-module execution times. The _artsupport_ package provides functions to enable (and I hope make easy) analysis of these data.
